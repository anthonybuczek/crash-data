Create a downloadable data set:
    Use a user defined formula for crash serverity
    Initially, use arterial shapefile overlay to limit crash set
        may expand to include other existing criteria
        may eventually include all streets, freeways, etc
    What is the lat/lng area covered by decimal places at 45N?
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees
        what is the range of N to S?
            44.99 N
            45.75 N
            centered ~ 45.5

Next steps

    use shapefile to filter dataset
        how to do this efficiently?
    show results on crash map
