Create a downloadable data set:
    Use a user defined formula for crash serverity
    Initially, use arterial shapefile overlay to limit crash set
        may expand to include other existing criteria
        may eventually include all streets, freeways, etc
    What is the lat/lng area covered by decimal places at 45N?
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees
        what is the range of N to S?
            44.99 N
            45.75 N
            centered ~ 45.5

Next steps


How many shapefile segments?
   what can the avg delta from 52' be?

Two actions
    To perform calculation
        All Crashes
            Arterial Crashes per 52x52
                weighted for severity & distance

    to show overlay of 'inside' & 'outside' arterial network.

Efficient Filtering
    Is this crash on an arterial?
    Which 52' x 52' polygon is this in?
